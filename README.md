eq("1+2") ➞ 3

eq("6/(9-7)") ➞ 3

eq("3+2-4") ➞ 1

* Return the value, not the equation.
* The method used to solve this challenge should not be used in practice. However, it's important to be aware of how this functionality works and why it should not be used.

# Assumptions
* We are only dealing with positive int values
* The only operands are + - * / and ()
* Do not worry about exceeding the memory limit of a long
